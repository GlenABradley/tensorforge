The previous AI engineer initiated the Tensor Forge project, an educational AI puzzle game. Initially, the project used Godot Engine for the frontend and Python/PyTorch for the backend. However, a pivotal decision was made by the AI engineer, with user approval, to **migrate the entire architecture to a React frontend and FastAPI backend**. This strategic shift aimed for better accessibility, richer AI integration, and leveraging the engineer's web development expertise.

The development focused on implementing Level 1: Train Your First AI Pet, involving an interactive drawing canvas and real PyTorch neural network training. Significant effort was spent on establishing the new web stack, setting up environment variables (especially for file watcher issues), and debugging frontend loading problems. Multiple iterations of UX improvements were made based on user feedback, clarifying instructions, button labels, and training state. The core functionality of Level 1, including backend training, is confirmed to be working, though the frontend's post-training display and perception of stuck training remain areas for refinement.

The Tensor Forge project is an educational puzzle game designed to teach AI concepts from basic tensors to LLMs. Players build AI systems via drag-and-drop mechanics, with real-time simulations using a simplified PyTorch-like backend. The game aims for 21 progressive levels, with mini-boss challenges every 3-4 levels. Initial aesthetics were steampunk-themed. The core vision emphasizes realistic AI simulations, enjoyable gameplay, and educational accuracy, allowing users to discover latent AI engineering talent.

Initial tasks included setting up dependencies (PyTorch, Godot), verifying existing backend/frontend components (Level 1 sim, simple drags), and implementing Level 2 (vector additions), Godot-Python integration, and steampunk flair.

**Current Implementation State (after architectural change):** The project has been refactored into a **React frontend** and **FastAPI/PyTorch backend**. Level 1, titled Train Your First AI Pet, is implemented. Users can draw shapes (circles, squares, triangles) on an HTML5 canvas, which a real PyTorch neural network learns to recognize. The AI pet provides interactive chat feedback. The UI incorporates components for building the AI network and a training panel. The backend successfully processes training data and provides accuracy scores. UX improvements have been made to clarify instructions, button states, and drawing interactions.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend post-training experience**: The user reported not knowing what happens after training and that the UI appeared to be stuck in training, despite the backend successfully completing the process.
-   **Clarity on component interactions**: Further clarify how components should be used to build the AI.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Currently, the Tensor Forge application has been successfully transformed from a Godot-based game into a functional **React + FastAPI web application**.

The core Level 1: Train Your First AI Pet functionality is implemented:
-   **User Interface**: A modern, dark-themed UI is displayed, featuring an AI Components section (Neural Layer, Activation Function), a Your AI Network building area, a Drawing Canvas for user input, and an AI Training panel. An AI chat component provides interactive messages from the AI pet.
-   **Drawing Interaction**: Users can draw circles, squares, or triangles on an HTML5 canvas. Drawings are automatically saved for training.
-   **Component Building**: Users can click Neural Layer and Activation Function buttons (though currently simple, representing the concept).
-   **Backend Integration**: The frontend successfully calls the FastAPI backend to retrieve level information and to initiate the AI training process.
-   **AI Training**: The backend utilizes PyTorch to train a real neural network on the user's drawn shapes. This training completes successfully, achieving high accuracy (e.g., 100%).
-   **Bug Fixes**: Initial issues with frontend loading due to file watcher limits in the Kubernetes environment were resolved by adding specific environment variables (, , ) and simplifying  for robust API calls.
-   **UX Improvements**: Instructions for building the AI brain and drawing have been clarified. The Clear button was renamed to Clear Canvas. The Start Training button now reflects Training Neural Network... with an animation, and educational explanations are displayed during training.

The immediate remaining issue is that while the backend training completes successfully (as verified by API responses), the frontend UI still appears stuck in the training state to the user, and there is no clear indication of what happens after training finishes.
