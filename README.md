# Tensor Forge

Educational puzzle game teaching AI from tensors to LLMs, steampunk style.

## Setup
1. Install Python 3.12+ and PyTorch: `pip install torch`
2. Install Godot Engine (free from godotengine.org)
3. Run backend tests: `python backend/engine.py`
4. Open frontend in Godot: Import project, run main scene.

## Folders
- backend: PyTorch simulations and level logic.
- frontend: Godot scenes/scripts for UI and drags.

More levels/components coming. Contributions welcome!
