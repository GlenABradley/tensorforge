# Testing Protocol for Tensor Forge Application

## User Problem Statement
The user reported that the frontend UI appears "stuck" in the training state after the PyTorch backend successfully completes training. The post-training experience is unclear and users don't know what happens after training completes.

## Current Issue Analysis
After investigation, the primary issue appears to be that the drawing canvas is not properly capturing and saving training data. Even when users attempt to draw shapes on the canvas, the training examples count remains at 0, preventing training from starting.

## Testing Protocol
1. **Backend Testing First**: Always test backend functionality using `deep_testing_backend_v2` before frontend testing
2. **Frontend Testing**: Only test frontend after user permission and backend validation
3. **Testing Sequence**: 
   - Test backend API endpoints
   - Test drawing functionality
   - Test training flow
   - Test post-training experience

## Incorporate User Feedback
- Focus on fixing the drawing canvas functionality
- Ensure training data is properly captured and saved
- Verify the complete training flow works end-to-end
- Improve post-training UI experience

## Testing Agent Communication
- Provide clear, specific test scenarios
- Report exact steps that fail
- Include relevant error messages and logs
- Test both success and failure scenarios

## Previous Test Results
- **Drawing Canvas**: Drawing strokes are not being captured properly
- **Training Data**: Training examples count remains at 0 despite drawing attempts
- **Training Button**: Remains disabled due to insufficient training data
- **Backend**: Not yet tested - need to verify API endpoints work correctly

## Next Steps
1. Test backend API endpoints to ensure they're working
2. Identify and fix the drawing canvas data capture issue
3. Verify complete training flow
4. Test post-training experience and UI state management
