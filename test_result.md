# Tensor Forge Backend API Testing Results

## Backend Testing Summary
All critical backend API endpoints have been tested and are working correctly. The PyTorch-based neural network training functionality is operational.

backend:
  - task: "Health Check Endpoint"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "✅ /api/health endpoint returns correct {status: 'healthy'} response with 200 status code"

  - task: "Level 1 Data Endpoint"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "✅ /api/levels/1 returns proper level structure with title 'Train Your First AI Pet', components (Neural Layer, Activation Function), and educational content"

  - task: "Shape Classifier Training Endpoint"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "✅ /api/train-shape-classifier successfully processes drawing data, trains PyTorch neural network, returns training history and predictions. Correctly handles insufficient data scenarios and invalid labels"

  - task: "Component Build Simulation"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "medium"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Minor: /api/simulate-build works correctly but returns 200 instead of 404 for invalid levels (error is still properly communicated in response body)"

  - task: "Error Handling and Validation"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "medium"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "✅ All endpoints properly validate input data, handle insufficient training examples, filter invalid labels, and return appropriate error messages"

frontend:
  - task: "Drawing Canvas Integration"
    implemented: false
    working: "NA"
    file: "frontend/src/App.js"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: true
    status_history:
      - working: "NA"
        agent: "main"
        comment: "Previous testing indicated drawing canvas not capturing data properly - needs frontend testing after user permission"

    message: "Backend API testing completed successfully. All critical endpoints (/api/health, /api/levels/1, /api/train-shape-classifier) are working correctly. PyTorch neural network training is functional with proper error handling. One minor issue: simulate-build returns 200 instead of 404 for invalid levels, but error is properly communicated. Ready for frontend testing after user permission."
